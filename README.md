# oci-cost-usage-snapshot
Built a standalone Python tool using the OCI SDK that captures a point in time snapshot of OCI usage. The tool collects resource metadata (Compute and Storage where available), generates structured JSON and Markdown reports, and uploads the artifacts to OCI Object Storage. Evidence includes execution output and the uploaded report objects in OCI.
